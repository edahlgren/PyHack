To run
   cd into ParseHN
      python parsehn.py
      
   Follow the prompts and have fun.
   
   Restart it to get realtime stats again   


I have included all of the modules I think you will need, inside the folder (really only Beautiful Soup).  The others should be in the standard python distribution.





Cheers!
